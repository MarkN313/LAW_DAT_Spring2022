# LAW.DAT-UI

These files reflect the client-side front-end code used to create the Risk Assessment Form for our Senior Project. We relied on
the React Javascript library for developing our project, with Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE.

To run this project, users should use the terminal to navigate to './RiskAssessmentForm/my-app' and enter the 'npm start' command.
If done properly, it should launch in the user's default web browser (Chrome preferred).
